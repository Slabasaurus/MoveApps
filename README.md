# qlik.dev tutorial: move apps using third party tooling

This example repository demonstrates using GitHub Actions to version & deploy apps
from a source tenant to a target tenant.

Refer to
the [move apps between tenants with automations and GitHub actions](https://qlik.dev/manage/platform-operations/third-party/move-apps-between-tenants)
tutorial for more information.

> **Important:**
> It is your responsibility to ensure that your usage of GitHub and GitHub Actions
> adheres to GitHub terms and conditions of service. This is provided as an example
> of how you can leverage Qlik APIs and third-party tooling to build integrated
> CICD and release processes.
